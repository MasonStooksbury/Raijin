A free, simple weather TUI that pulls data without the need for an API key, account, or subscription. Weather data is from [NWS](https://api.weather.gov/) and [OpenMeteo](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs). Moon phase data is from [ViewBits](https://viewbits.com/docs/moon-phase-api-documentation).

## Develop
When editing the logo.txt or any of the moon phases, make sure every line has the exact same length (even if there are just blank lines). This will ensure that it can be centered and manipulated properly by Ratatui.
